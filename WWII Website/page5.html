        <strong>What role did some of the mistakes from WWI contribute to WWII? Why?</strong><br>
        After World War I the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations were made to prevent another world war but they would actually contribute to the outbreak of WW2. The reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles were unreasonably harsh and over punishing for Germany. Many leaders of the day were shocked at the level of payments demanded. And yet, Germany was not the nation that started the war. Germany struggled to meet the payment obligations as their economy was struggling with the costs of war, and the loss of territories and resources. All this would lead to the hyperinflation of the germany economy and the Germany falling into Great Depression. This depression would leave the people vulnerable to being manipulated by someone like Adolf Hitler. The League of Nations, created to maintain international peace and prevent future conflicts, failed to effectively fulfill its mission. The two combined factors highly contributed to the outbreak of World War 2

        <strong>How did WW2 impact england's world power?</strong><br>
        World War II had a large impact on England's world power. England's political influence and economic standing both increased significantly. As WW2 happened, England was at the front of the Allied forces, facing the full might of Nazi Germany. The war required a huge amount of resources and manpower, leading to a transformation in England's industrial and military capabilities. While the country suffered heavy losses and endured the devastating Blitz, its resilience and determination played a massive role in the defeat of the Axis powers. However, the war's had a huge toll on England's economy and infrastructure, in addition with the United States and the Soviet Union becoming global superpowers, started the beginning of a slow decline in England's status as a dominant world power.
